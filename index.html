<p> <<i> The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed which originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales.</i> </p>
<p> The Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds extensively, often daily, with coat "blow outs" often twice a year. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears which are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The ears should also be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. </p>
